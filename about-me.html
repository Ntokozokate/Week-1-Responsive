          Throughout the history of my learning to code journey, I have not come
          across a stage where I would say ‚ÄúOh this was easy‚Äù. Of-cause HTML and
          CSS don't seem that hard now. When I was being introduced to them,
          they seemed pretty hard. Every stage seemed like it would always be
          this hard. But redoing the concepts helped me a great deal. I decided
          that if anything was to ever seem very hard for me I have to repeat it
          at least 3 to 5 times to make it stick. Another technique that helped
          me cope was that when I am stuck, the sooner I start over the better.
          Somehow whenever I retarted something I almost always got it the
          second time. It was better than looking for a small mistake in the
          same place for hours when I could simply restart.
